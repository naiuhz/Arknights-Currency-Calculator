ToDo list: 
  ☐ Furniture Parts
  ☐ LMD
  ☐ EXP
  ☐ SV

SanityCarryOver:
  ☐ Use dateTest.js to create a simplified script:
    ☐ calculate when to start saving sanity
    ☐ how much sanity to consume
    ☐ when to wake up
    ☐ optional bedtime and wakeup hours

Scheduler:
    ☐ What to do today @est(1.5 hours)
      ☐ Add to ASAP calculator and consider local bed time
  Add certificate store furniture parts: 
    ☐ Need to calculate shop items left @est(2 hours)
  Add level up sanity recharge notice:
    ☐ Level up after consuming how much sanity and on which day @est(1.5 hours)
    ☐ Suggest leveling up on a supply day @est(1 hour)
  Earliest goal achievable date:
    ☐ Available if inventory is below goal, but inventory and income is above goal @est(2 hours)
    ☐ Missing goal date, calculate currency sequentially day by day @est(6 hours) 
    ☐ Requires sanity potions available @est(6 hours)
      ☐ Sanity potions categorized by type and quantity
        ☐ eg. "Emergency Sanity Potion" : {[(5, "2020 June 22"), (1, "2020 June 15")]}
    ☐ What if you need to farm less than total runs?
  ☐ Change currency_income.json's monthly income into arrays or dictionaries
  ☐ Error in calculateASAPRuns function if current currency is equal to goal
  ☐ If not all runs need to be expended within the day [(run rewards+base income)>goal]
    ☐ Then try to calculate minimum runs needed and/or how long for base income to satisfy goal
  ☐ Suggest base setups (153 vs 243)

Maybe list:
  ☐ Possible bedtimes
    ☐ Requires current/wake up times?
