**How to input values into the Calculator.**

In `data.json`, you can change the values to enter the information extracted from your Arknights account.

`optional`

Like its name suggests, you do not have to modify these values to get your answer, but it would give you a more accurate answer if you enter in your values.

`goalDate` (WIP)

The date you wish to achieve your goal by. Enter the date in ISO format: "YYYY-MM-DD". If you don't have a date to achieve your goal, leave the value as "false".

`timezoneCity`

The city you wish to change the local time to. Enter the city in locale format: "Continent/City", eg. "America/Toronto". If you don't have a city to enter, leave the value as "false".
Note: This overrides timezoneUTC if the value isn't "false".

`timezoneUTC`

The UTC timezone you wish to change the local time to. Enter the UTC timezone as an integer, eg. "-7". 
Note: Positive integers should not include plus (+) signs in the value.
